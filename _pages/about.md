I am a second-year Master student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), advised by Professor [Noseong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/npark/home?authuser=0). 


Building on my undergraduate background in neuroscience, I am also interested in brain-inspired artificial intelligence as a longer-term research direction.

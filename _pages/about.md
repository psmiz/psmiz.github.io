I am a second-year Master student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), advised by Professor [Noseong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/npark/home?authuser=0). My research generally lies in LLM architectures, representation learning, and interpretability in large language models. Specifically, my recent work focuses on linear attention mechanisms based on state-space dynamics and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures for efficient and scalable LLMs.

Building on my undergraduate background in neuroscience, I am also interested in brain-inspired AI as a longer-term research direction, exploring how principles of biological learning can enhance the architectural design of language models.

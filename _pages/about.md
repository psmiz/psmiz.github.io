I am a second-year Master student at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), advised by Professor [Noseong Park](https://sites.google.com/view/npark/home?authuser=0). My research generally focuses on interpretable LLM architectures, and representation learning for sequential and graph-structured data. Specifically, my recent work focuses on linear attention mechanisms based on state-space dynamics and Mixture-of-Experts architectures for efficient and scalable LLMs.

Building on my undergraduate background in neuroscience, my longer-term research direction lies in brain-inspired inductive biases as a conceptual framework for understanding and designing neural architectures and learning dynamics.


<!-- , exploring how principles of biological learning can enhance the architectural design of language models.
More broadly, I am interested in understanding how inductive biases embedded in model architectures shape optimization dynamics and learned representations.
